# Inferno for iPhone

An emulated iPhone 11, running as an app on a real iPhone.

This is a SwiftUI front end for [Inferno](https://github.com/ChefKissInc/Inferno) — ChefKiss's
QEMU fork that emulates Apple's T8030 (A13) platform well enough to boot iOS 14. The emulator is
built as a library and loaded into the app, so there is no helper process, no server, and nothing
to connect to: the machine runs inside the app that draws it.

> Inferno itself is by [Visual Ehrmanntraut](https://github.com/VisualEhrmanntraut) and the Inferno
> team at [ChefKiss](https://github.com/ChefKissInc). This repository is the iOS app around it, plus
> the changes to the emulator that iOS made necessary. **It is unofficial**, and not affiliated with
> or endorsed by ChefKiss.

## What works

- **The guest's screen**, drawn from the emulator's own framebuffer memory — no VNC, no encoding,
  no socket. Touches land where your finger is.
- **Device buttons** — side button, volume, home.
- **Internet in the guest, with no companion VM.** The app is its own USB host: it switches the
  emulated device into CDC-NCM mode and lets traffic out through slirp. `apt` works.
- **File transfer both ways**, over that same link — about 500 KB/s. Files sent to the guest land
  where the guest's own Files app can see them.
- **A shell into the guest**, on a channel of its own so the kernel log does not shred it.
- **A real terminal**, not a log view: eighty columns, colours, cursor movement. `neofetch` draws
  its logo beside the text, `apt` redraws its progress line in place.

## What does not

- **Speed.** There is no KVM on iOS and there never will be — everything is translated. Boot takes
  minutes, not seconds.
- **Only 3 GiB.** iOS kills a process at exactly that, entitlement or no entitlement, so the guest
  gets 2 GB and the rest is the app's own.
- **Only 828×1792.** The machine accepts other panel sizes and the guest boots on them, but iOS
  then draws nothing at all. Not solved.
- **The guest sometimes drops its own network** after using it — a known iOS behaviour, worked
  around by asking it to bring the interface back up.

---

## What you need

**A jailbroken guest image.** Not distributed here, and not optional. Follow ChefKiss's guides to
build one, then apply the jailbreak bootstrap:

- [Inferno setup](https://chefkiss.dev/guides/inferno/)
- [Jailbreak bootstrap](https://chefkiss.dev/guides/inferno-post-setup/jailbreak-bootstrap/)

> **The bootstrap is required, not a nicety.** Without bash on the guest's console there is no file
> transfer, no shell, and no way to bring the network up from inside. Half of what this app does
> talks to that shell.

**A device that can run the app with JIT.** The translator has to make memory executable, which iOS
does not allow on its own. [StikDebug](https://github.com/StephenDev0/StikDebug) provides it.

**About 9 GB free** for the guest image.

---

## Installing

1. **Build the guest image** by ChefKiss's guide, and apply the jailbreak patches.

2. **Get `Inferno.ipa`** from [Releases](https://github.com/MakrSas/Inferno-iOS/releases), or build
   it yourself (see [Building](#building)). **Install it and StikDebug** with any sideloading tool —
   iLoader, AltStore, Sideloadly.

   StikDebug also needs **LocalDevVPN**, which is on the App Store. It is not a VPN in the usual
   sense — it is what lets the debugger reach the device over its own loopback.

3. **Set StikDebug up**: turn LocalDevVPN on, and put your pairing file into StikDebug (iLoader can
   hand it over).

4. **Assign the script, then launch Inferno through StikDebug**, so it starts with JIT. Before
   launching, long-press Inferno in StikDebug, choose **Assign Script** and pick **`legacy.js`**.
   Then launch it, and check that the app's folder has appeared in Files → On My iPhone → Inferno.

5. **Copy the guest images in.** Put `AppleSEPROM-Cebu-B1` and the `InfernoData` folder into that
   folder. The empty directories are already there; the files go straight into them:

   ```
   AppleSEPROM-Cebu-B1
   InfernoData/root.qcow2        (or root — the raw image)
   InfernoData/firmware
   InfernoData/syscfg
   InfernoData/ctrl_bits
   InfernoData/nvram
   InfernoData/effaceable
   InfernoData/panic_log
   InfernoData/sep_nvram
   InfernoData/sep_ssc
   InfernoData/root_ticket.der
   InfernoData/sep-firmware.n104.RELEASE.new.img4
   InfernoData/Restore/kernelcache.release.iphone12b
   InfernoData/Restore/Firmware/038-44135-124.dmg.trustcache
   InfernoData/Restore/Firmware/all_flash/DeviceTree.n104ap.im4p
   ```

   > **Take `root.qcow2`, not the raw `root`.** The raw image is nominally 34 GB holding about 9 GB
   > of data, and it relies on the file being sparse — which copying to a phone loses. The qcow2 is
   > its real size however you move it.

6. **Relaunch the app through StikDebug**, open the menu and start the machine.

**Always start it through StikDebug.** Without JIT the emulator does not fail cleanly — it wedges on
the first translated instruction, which looks like a hang and is much harder to read than a refusal.
The app checks and refuses instead.

---

## Using it

**The button** in the corner opens everything: the view (screen or terminal), starting and stopping
the machine, files, device buttons. Drag it wherever you like.

**Network.** On by default. If the guest never takes an address, the menu has *Bring the network up
in the guest*, which runs `ipconfig set en0 DHCP` on its console — the same thing the stock guide
tells you to type by hand.

**Files.** *Send a file to the guest* puts it where the guest's own Files app will find it.
*Fetch a file from the guest* takes a path and saves it into the app's `Guest` folder, visible in
Files on the host phone.

**The shell.** The terminal's *Shell* tab opens a channel into the guest. Where the network is up it
goes over a socket; where it is not, it falls back to the console with the shell's output marked so
the kernel's cannot be mistaken for it.

**Settings** hold everything else: cores, memory, translator, screen, terminal, language, and
diagnostics.

## Building

You need a Mac with Xcode — this is built with Xcode 27.0 (27A5237l) and the iOS 27 SDK; older
versions have not been tried — and the emulator's dependencies built for arm64 iOS into one prefix:
glib, pixman, libslirp, libucontext, lzfse, libpng, gmp, nettle and libtasn1.

The emulator lives in its own repository — [a fork of Inferno](https://github.com/MakrSas/Inferno/tree/ios)
carrying the changes iOS needed: the USB-NCM host, the built-in display, the coalesced UART, the
address-space memory patch. Clone it beside this one:

```bash
git clone -b ios https://github.com/MakrSas/Inferno.git inferno-src
```

Meson cross-files hold absolute paths — the SDK, the toolchain, wherever the dependencies were
built — so this one is generated rather than committed:

```bash
PREFIX=path/to/built/deps ./make-cross-file.sh
```

Then build the emulator as a shared library for iOS:

```bash
meson setup build/inferno inferno-src \
  --cross-file=cross-ios-arm64.txt \
  -Dbuildtype=release -Dprefix=$PWD/prefix \
  -Dshared_lib=true -Db_staticpic=true -Dwerror=false \
  -Dkvm=disabled -Dhvf=disabled -Dwhpx=disabled \
  -Dcocoa=disabled -Dgtk=disabled -Dsdl=disabled -Dcurses=disabled \
  -Dcoreaudio=disabled -Dcurl=disabled -Dlibssh=disabled -Dbzip2=disabled \
  -Dvnc=enabled -Dvnc_jpeg=disabled -Dvnc_sasl=disabled \
  -Dtools=disabled -Dcoroutine_backend=ucontext

ninja -C build/inferno libqemu-aarch64-softmmu.dylib
```

`-Dshared_lib=true` is what makes it a library rather than a program; `ucontext` replaces the
coroutine backend because iOS has no usable `sigaltstack`. VNC stays enabled — the app draws from
the framebuffer directly, but the VNC path is still there as a fallback in the settings.

Then the app:

```bash
cd app && ./build.sh
```

`build.sh` compiles the SwiftUI front end with `swiftc`, bundles the emulator library, renders the
app icon with `actool`, ad-hoc signs everything and produces `Inferno.ipa`. Besides Xcode's command
line tools it needs QEMU's keymaps — `brew install qemu` provides them, or point `INFERNO_KEYMAPS`
at a copy. There is no Xcode project.

### Without a Mac — GitHub Actions

[`.github/workflows/build-ipa.yml`](.github/workflows/build-ipa.yml) does all of the above on
GitHub's own macOS runners, so a fork can produce an installable (unsigned) `Inferno.ipa` without
anyone owning a Mac. It runs on every push to `main`, on `workflow_dispatch`, and — attaching the
`.ipa` to the release — on any `v*` tag.

The nine iOS dependencies are built from source by
[`scripts/build-ios-deps.sh`](scripts/build-ios-deps.sh) (which also works locally:
`PREFIX=$PWD/prefix scripts/build-ios-deps.sh`) and the resulting `prefix/` is cached, keyed on that
script and the runner's Xcode, so only the first run pays the ~20-minute cost. The workflow still
does not touch any guest image, firmware or Apple key — those are yours to build.

The runner is `macos-26`, so `actool` there compiles `Inferno.icon` (Icon Composer, Xcode 26+)
directly — the built `.ipa` gets the real Liquid Glass icon, not a placeholder. `app/build.sh`
still probes `actool` before using it and falls back to `app/Resources/Assets.xcassets` — a flat
PNG rendering of the same artwork — if it ever runs on an older Xcode.

## Issues and ideas

**[Open an issue](https://github.com/MakrSas/Inferno-iOS/issues/new/choose) for anything at all:**

- **Something broke** — a crash, a hang, a black screen, a guest that will not boot or will not get
  an address.
- **Something could be better** — anything awkward, slow, confusing, or missing from the menu.
- **Something new** — a feature you would like to see, even a half-formed one.

Write in English or Russian, whichever is easier. For a bug it helps to know the iPhone and its iOS
version, the app's build (at the bottom of Settings), what you did and what happened. The app keeps
`emulator.log` and `guest-console.log` in its folder in Files; attach them if you can.

Pull requests are welcome too.

## Helping out

Most of what was learned here is written down, because most of it was expensive to learn. The notes
are in Russian, the language the work was done in.

- **[`TODO.md`](TODO.md)** — everything still open, with the reasoning behind each item and what was
  already ruled out. The best place to start.
- **[`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md)** — how the SEP panic was actually diagnosed. Worth reading not for
  the answer but for the method: a controlled A/B on identical state, which is what finally
  separated a real cause from three plausible ones.
- **[`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)** — the traps, and there are many. The console has no
  flow control. A path with a space in it will not survive a long command. `"\r\n"` is one
  `Character` in Swift, and its `asciiValue` is a line feed.
- **[`ANDROID-PORT.md`](ANDROID-PORT.md)** — what the same app on Android would take. Android is the
  easier platform: executable memory is allowed, so no JIT helper, no split-wx, no 3 GiB ceiling.
- **[`HAPTICS-NOTES.md`](HAPTICS-NOTES.md)** — passing the guest's vibration through to the real
  phone.

### The test stand

Trying something against the guest on the phone costs a boot of several minutes. `macos-repro.sh`
runs the same machine natively on a Mac against a qcow2 overlay, so a hypothesis costs a minute and
leaves the real image untouched:

```bash
INFERNO_SRC=path/to/fork INFERNO_STAGE=path/to/images \
  ./macos-repro.sh mytest fresh on "some marker" 120
```

### The tools

`netlab/` holds what the USB and network work was built out of, in Python, small enough to read:
`tcpusb.py` speaks the emulator's URB protocol, `ncm.py` brings a CDC-NCM link up by hand,
`lockdown.py` and `pair.py` do usbmux and pairing, `slice.py` and `splice.py` take an APFS container
out of a disk image and put it back. `guestfs.py` moves files over the console alone, no network.

> `install-bootstrap.sh` needs sudo and rewrites somebody's guest image. Read it before running it.

Inferno's boot splash artwork belongs to ChefKiss and is not covered by those licences, so builds
from here leave it out, and the screen stays dark until the guest draws.

No Apple firmware, image or key is distributed here, and none ever will be.
